## Frontend Features (Conceptual)

### Master Prompt Editor
*   **Prompt Management & Versioning**: Centralized repository, semantic versioning, automated LLM call logging, rollback capabilities, metadata, API decoupling, intuitive playgrounds.
*   **Advanced Prompt Engineering Techniques**: Support for Zero-shot, Few-shot, Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Meta-prompting, Persona-based, Generate Knowledge, and Self-consistency prompting.
*   **Automated Prompt Optimization & Evaluation**: A/B testing, comprehensive evaluation metrics, Meta-learning, Gradient-based Optimization, DSPy integration, LLMOps integration for observability, benchmarking, and dataset management.
*   **Collaborative Workflows**: Role-based access, approval workflows, formal review processes, team collaboration tools, CI/CD integration.

### Advanced AI Toolkit
*   **Multimodal AI Integration**: Unified system for text, images, audio, video processing via Feature-Level, Decision-Level, and Joint Embedding Spaces fusion. Integration of specialized neural networks (YOLO, CLIP, Llama).
*   **AI Task Chaining & Workflow Automation**: Prompt chaining, visualized graph orchestration, no-code/low-code capabilities for automating content creation, data analysis, architectural design, and software development tasks.
