# Contributing to Master-Prompt-Editor

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Master Prompt Editor! This project aims to build the ultimate AI toolkit with collaborative features, responsible AI integration, and multimodal support.

## üåü New Architecture Overview

This project now includes several key areas for contribution:
- **Backend Services**: Collaboration, evaluation, responsible AI, and multimodal processing
- **Frontend Components**: React components for voting, commenting, bias detection, and multimodal inputs
- **CLI Tool**: Command-line interface for power users and automation
- **API Integration**: RESTful APIs connecting all features

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- TypeScript 5.4+
- Basic understanding of React, Express, and REST APIs

### Development Setup

1. **Fork and clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Master-Prompt-Editor.git
   cd Master-Prompt-Editor
   ```

2. **Install all dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm run install:all
   ```

3. **Build the project:**
   ```bash
   npm run build:all
   ```

4. **Start development servers:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev  # Starts both frontend and backend
   ```

5. **Test the CLI:**
   ```bash
   cd cli
   npm run build
   node dist/index.js health
   ```

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Areas

### Backend Services (`server/src/services/`)
- **CollaborationService.ts**: Voting, commenting, shared libraries
- **MirascopeService.ts**: Evaluation, versioning, A/B testing
- **ResponsibleAIService.ts**: Bias detection, ethical templates
- **MultimodalService.ts**: Cross-modal processing, format validation

### API Routes (`server/src/routes/`)
- **collaborationRoutes.ts**: Voting, commenting, library management
- **evaluationRoutes.ts**: Performance evaluation, cost analytics
- **responsibleAIRoutes.ts**: Bias detection, ethical validation
- **multimodalRoutes.ts**: Media processing, template generation

### Frontend Components (`src/components/ui/`)
- **VotingComponent.tsx**: Community voting interface
- **CommentsSection.tsx**: Threaded comments with annotations
- **ResponsibleAIDashboard.tsx**: Bias detection and ethical analysis
- **MultimodalInputStub.tsx**: Multimodal input handling

### CLI Tool (`cli/`)
- **index.ts**: Command-line interface with full API integration

## üìù Coding Standards

### TypeScript Guidelines
- Use strict typing - avoid `any`, prefer `unknown` when needed
- Define interfaces for all data structures
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs

### React Components
- Use functional components with hooks
- Implement proper TypeScript interfaces for props
- Handle loading and error states appropriately
- Follow accessibility best practices

### API Development
- Use proper HTTP status codes
- Implement comprehensive error handling
- Add input validation for all endpoints
- Follow RESTful conventions

### Code Style
- Use ESLint and Prettier (configured in the project)
- Follow existing code patterns and naming conventions
- Keep functions small and focused
- Write self-documenting code

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Backend Testing
- Test all API endpoints with various inputs
- Mock external dependencies appropriately
- Test error conditions and edge cases
- Validate type safety and data integrity

### Frontend Testing
- Test component rendering and user interactions
- Mock API calls in component tests
- Test accessibility features
- Verify responsive design

### CLI Testing
- Test all CLI commands and options
- Verify error handling and user feedback
- Test integration with API endpoints
- Validate help text and documentation

2. **Discuss the approach** with maintainers
3. **Fork the repository** and create a feature branch
4. **Follow the naming convention**: `feature/description` or `fix/description`

### Development Process
1. **Make incremental commits** with clear messages
2. **Run tests and linting** before committing:
   ```bash
   npm run build:all
   npm run lint:all
   ```
3. **Test your changes thoroughly**
4. **Update documentation** if needed

### Pull Request Process
1. **Ensure all tests pass** and code builds successfully
2. **Update README.md** if you've added new features
3. **Write a clear PR description** explaining:
   - What changes were made
